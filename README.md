# Snake_Game_Kotlin

This is a Kotlin-based web application that implements a simple game login system and player score tracking. 
It uses Spark Framework for the server-side routing, interacting with a MySQL database for storing and retrieving player data and scores, with Handlebars templates rendering the front-end. 
The application supports features like user authentication, game score management, and displaying the top results.
